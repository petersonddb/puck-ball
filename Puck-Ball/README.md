# Puck-Ball

## Development

This client project was started from "Core/3D (Built-In Render Pipeline)" Unity template; it seemed like the most "from scratch" option for this basis-practicing & experimentation project.

Nakama SDK (for game server integration) was imported into the project from Assets Store; ideally, it should have been added as a dependency from a external registry for proper package management (a way would be to add it directly to `manifest.json`, including its registry information).
