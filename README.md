# Puck-Ball

## The Game

It is nice to provide a meaningful name to a game; this game is essentially a collectibles hunting with spheric characters; this is loosely similar to Pac-Man; hence the name.

The gameplay is physics-based: control your character using the axis (or WASD); a force will be applied to the ball in the inputted direction; don't confuse this force with instant acceleration, velocity or even impulse/momentum, it is mass-dependent; this creates an interesting and realistic challenge for braking or changing directions.
